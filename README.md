# CiS1

### Endsems

Endsems contains most of the stuff that was explored and discovered during the informal meeting in room 346 and is speculated to come in the CiS exam.
It also contains the tutorial pdfs from the official namd website.

### Download this if possible

This contains the tutorial pdf and files required from official vmd website. The required files were too large to upload on github so instead uploaded here. <br>
